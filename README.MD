# Sudoku Solver &  Visualizer
This is a Python-based Sudoku Solver and Visualizer built with Tkinter. The tool lets users input a Sudoku puzzle, and it visually solves the puzzle using backtracking, showing each step to provide a clear understanding of the solving algorithm.

# Features
* **Backtracking Algorithm:** Implements the backtracking algorithm to solve Sudoku puzzles, exploring possible values in each cell and using recursion to find a solution.
* **Step-by-Step Visualization:** Animates each step of the solving process, allowing users to see how the algorithm proceeds through different states.

# Note
This project is functional but I am still improving UI and and code layout in certain areas.
